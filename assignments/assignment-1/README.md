### Details

In this assignment, we are going to take an array of data and turn that into tiles on the index page.
These tiles are created from data that looks like the following:

```js
const item = {
    name: 'Item A',
    color: 'red',
    price: 0.23
}
```

## How will this be marked?

#### I will not mark your assignment until the following is true:

-   Can I visit a github repo?
-   Can I visit a url to see the final result?
- Are the assets correctly connected (css, imgs) when I visit the url

#### Requirements

I will be asking the following questions

-   Do the tiles match the data in the javascript file
-   Did your solution use a loop?
-   Did you use variables
-   Did you keep your code shallow (did you stay under 2 nested levels)
